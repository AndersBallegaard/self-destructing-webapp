## A small python webapp that will reboot your host if it isn't loaded every 10 seconds 

## Reasons not to run this

* At some point it will end in downtime
* It's a stupid idea (both to run and as a project)

## Reasons to run this

* Run it if you have a really specific problem that would be solved by rebooting the server when a monitoring service isn't contacting it.
